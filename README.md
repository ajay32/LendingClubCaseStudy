then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

Using following steps to data processing.

Step 3: Segemented Univariate Analysis
Step 4: Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis
Step 5: Results/Conclusion
